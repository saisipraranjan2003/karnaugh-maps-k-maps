# karnaugh-maps-k-maps
Hello Students, This is a KARNAUGH MAP (K-MAP) project which I have written in the Python Programming Language. This project has various features such as that we have to guess a number between 1 to 100 in between 5 trials/chances. If we pick the correct number between the 5 chances, then we will win.
